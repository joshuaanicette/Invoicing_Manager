## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL database
- pip (Python package manager)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Invoicing_System_2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Deployment

**ðŸš€ Easiest Way: Use Vercel Postgres (Recommended)**

See [VERCEL_POSTGRES_SETUP.md](VERCEL_POSTGRES_SETUP.md) for the **2-minute setup guide**.

Just 3 steps:
1. Create Vercel Postgres database in your dashboard
2. Connect it to your project
3. Redeploy

No configuration needed - it works automatically! âœ¨
